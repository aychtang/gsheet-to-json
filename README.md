gsheet-to-json
==============

Convert your Google Doc spreadsheets to JSON, in the browser.  This is not an API method.

It is for you to work with your data in Google Spreadsheets, then copy out the resulting JSON conversion to paste somewhere.

Row 1 must dictate the type of data you have in that column (string (or blank), dict, or list are supported.)

Row 2 must be the column headers.

Rows 3+ are your data.
